It has been shown to be as accurate as computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan for detecting lymph node metastasis. Ultrasound is also useful in evaluating the extent of disease in patients with locally advanced penile cancer.\n\n### Long answer\n\nUltrasound is a noninvasive, radiation-free imaging modality that can be used to evaluate soft tissue masses and lymph nodes. It is widely available and relatively inexpensive compared with other imaging modalities such as CT scan, MRI, or PET/CT scan. Ultrasound has been shown",

It involves mixing the blood and organs of the deceased with alcohol.  This mixture is then placed into a sealed container, such as a bottle or a clay pot (called a dhari).\n\nThe process of making Raksi is similar to that of making homemade alcohol in other parts of the world.  First, the blood and organs are removed from the body.  The blood is then mixed with water and yeast.  This mixture is then fermented for a period of time.\n\nThe resulting Raksi can be used to preserve dead bodies.  It can also be used as an ingredient in other recipes, such as chut",

They found that patients with symptoms were more likely to experience an adverse event than those without symptoms, even after adjusting for other factors such as age and gender.\n\nThis is an important finding because it suggests that clinicians should be aware of the potential risks associated with treating patients who are experiencing symptoms when making decisions about whether or not to enroll them in a clinical trial. This information can help clinicians make informed decisions about which patients are most likely to benefit from participation in a study and minimize any potential harm that may come from participating in the trial.\n\n### Short answer\n\nYes, they do.",

The prevalence of type 1 diabetes is increasing worldwide.\n\nType 2 diabetes is also a disease where insulin production is lost.

The study was done in 1987, and the authors found that the mean birthweight for white babies was 3400 grams, while the mean birthweight for Aboriginal babies was 3250 grams.\n\nThe question asks whether this difference is due to misclassification of gestational age in the Aboriginal population. The authors of the study did not think so, but they were not sure. They suggested that there might be other reasons for the difference, such as genetic differences between the two groups or environmental factors.\n\nThe PubMedQA program was used to answer this question by looking at the full text of the article and finding out if there is any evidence in the study",

It involves inserting a thin catheter into the vein, delivering laser energy to the vessel wall and causing it to collapse. The saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) is the most common site of access for EVLA. However, there are other possible sites of access including the great saphenous vein (GSV), small saphenous vein (SSV), and perforator veins.\n\n### Long answer\n\nVaricose veins occur when valves in the superficial venous system fail to close properly, causing blood to pool in the lower extremity. This leads to an increase in venous pressure and ultimately dilated, tortuous veins. The most common cause of varicose ve",

Anorectal malformations can range from mild to severe, with some patients having a single defect while others have multiple defects. The incidence of anorectal malformations in the United States is 1:5000 live births.\n\nThe diagnosis of anorectal malformation is made by physical examination and radiographic evaluation.

The CPB machine has a cooling system that keeps the patient's core temperature low during the operation, which can cause hypothermia in the patient after the operation is over.\nHypothermia is defined as a core body temperature below 36\u00b0C (97\u00b0F).  It is known to be associated with an increased risk of complications and mortality.  Euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS) is a condition where patients who are hypothyroid after surgery have normal thyroid function tests.\nThis PubMedQA question was asked by a medical student at the University of",

The prevalence of ET in the general population has been estimated to be 0.9% and increases with age.1 It is more common in men than women (2:1) and most commonly affects individuals over the age of 65 years.1\n\nET can be difficult to distinguish from Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD).

The question could be interpreted as asking whether increasing the concentration of hydrogen ions in the blood stimulates protein synthesis.  However, that would seem to make no sense at all - why would increasing the concentration of a chemical that is normally found in very low concentrations have any effect on protein synthesis?\n\nIt's also not clear what they mean by \"dialysis patients\".

The risk of VTE is increased by immobilization and surgery, which are common after traumatic injury. In addition, the use of anticoagulation has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with pulmonary emboli (PE).\n\nIn 1956, Mendelson et al. published a study showing that heparin was safe for use in trauma patients",

The two most common treatments are radical prostatectomy (surgical removal) and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). These treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of death from prostate cancer, but they also come with significant side effects. In particular, EBRT can cause urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction.\n\nIn 2013, a study was published that compared radical prostatectomy (RP) to external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for patients with localized prostate cancer. The results showed that RP had significantly higher rates of urinary incontinence and ere",

The long answer is that there are several reasons why older patients may not receive adequate stroke care, including:\n1. Older patients have a higher risk of stroke than younger people. 2. Older patients are more likely to have multiple comorbidities (such as heart disease and diabetes) which can make it difficult for them to recover from strokes. 3. Older patients may be less likely to receive aggressive treatment because they are considered to be at higher risk of complications from surgery or other invasive procedures.\n\n### Short answer:\nNo, they don't.\n\n### Longer",

The study design is appropriate and the methodology sound. However, the results are disappointing. The authors conclude that simplification of pH data analysis is not feasible because the interobserver agreement was poor (\u03ba = 0.41). This conclusion is based on the finding that only 65% of the observations were in agreement between observers.\n\nThe authors do not mention the number of observations in their study, but a quick calculation shows that this \u2026\n\n : /embed/graphic-1.gif\n : /embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\n : /embed/inline-graphic-2.gif\n : /embed/inline-graphic-3.gif\n : /embed",

It is performed by injecting local anesthetic into the sacral hiatus, which is located just below the sacrum at the level of S2-S3. The parasacral sciatic nerve block can be performed using a landmark technique or ultrasound guidance.\n\nThe success rate of the parasacral sciatic nerve block is reported to range from 70% to 95%. The reason for this wide range in success rates could be due to differences in the injection techniques, local anesthetic doses, and patient populations. In addition, it has been suggested that the elicited motor response (EMR) can predict the",

They are often based on measurable aspects of care that can be easily recorded and compared across hospitals. Examples include rates of surgery within 24 hours of admission for patients with appendicitis, or rates of colonoscopy after a positive fecal occult blood test.\n\nProcess indicators are often used to compare the quality of care provided by different hospitals and clinics. However, it is important to remember that they do not directly measure patient outcomes such as mortality or morbidity. Instead, they provide an indirect measure of the quality of care by assessing whether certain aspects of care were delivered according to established guidelines or standards",

It is regulated by a complex interplay between osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes. Osteoblasts are responsible for synthesizing bone matrix proteins and mineralizing the matrix. Osteoclasts are responsible for degrading the old bone matrix. Osteocytes are the most abundant cell type in bone and play a role in regulating osteoblast and osteoclast activity.\nBiochemical markers of bone turnover, such as serum C-terminal telopeptide (CTX)",

It has been used for many years to prevent local recurrence of disease after mastectomy. The rationale behind its use was based on the observation that patients who had undergone mastectomy and axillary node dissection were at risk for local recurrence. This risk was estimated to be 10%-25%.\n\nThe first randomized trial of chest wall irradiation after mastectomy was published in 1974 by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG). In this trial, patients were randomized to receive either chest wall irradiation or no additional treatment. The results showed that there was a significant reduction in local recurrence in the group receiving ch",

They act by binding to hydroxyapatite crystals on the surface of bone, where they are internalized by osteoclasts and inhibit their function.\n\nBisphosphonates have been used as a treatment for children with skeletal fragility since 1987. The first report was of a child with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, who developed severe osteoporosis and fractures despite conventional therapy.

Bipolar disorder affects 1% of the population, but it is often misdiagnosed as unipolar major depression, which affects 8% of the population. The reason for this high rate of misdiagnosis is that bipolar disorder and unipolar depression are very similar in presentation and symptomatology.\n\nBoth bipolar disorder and unipolar depression can present with a variety of symptoms, including insomnia, fatigue, irritability, aggression, anxiety, and",

The `> test.txt` syntax is used to append text to the end of the existing file, which is why we need to use `test.txt` as an argument to `cat`.\n\nThe `yes` and `no` strings are appended to the end of the file. They are not part of the question. The `Final Answer: yes|no|maybe` line is added by the program. It is the final output of the program.\n\n### Hints\n- Use the `echo",
